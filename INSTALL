WARNING: The FISSURES framework is actively being developed, has not yet been
debugged and has many unimplemented or partially implemented features. Thus
this does not constitute a true distribution, merely a snapshot of the
development. And so "installing" it is not recomended at this point.

However, if you would like to play with it, this is what you need to do.

You must have a Java 1.2 or better installed. As of this writting
Java 1.3 is the current release from Sun and is availible for Solaris,
Linux and Windows. I mostly have used 1.2.2, but 1.3 should be fine as well

You need to get and install a corba 2.3 compilant ORB. The Orbacus Java ORB 
from OOC, Inc is the orb that has been used to develop fissures, and is the
recommended orb. Orbacus makes a very well done Corba 2.3 compliant ORB and 
have a "free for noncommercial" license. You are responsible for verifying 
that you are elligible to use Orbacus under this license. You will need both 
OB.jar which contains the ORB and OBNaming,jar, which contains the Orbacus 
naming service. You might as well install all of Orbacus, as fissures may 
begin to make use of other parts of it in the future. It is likely that 
fissures will work with other Corba2.3 compilant ORBs, but it has only been 
tested under Orbacus.
